Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget, and at least $150 million in cuts from the National Institutes of Health. The campus gets, on average, about $50 million a month from the agency.

Funding from the National Science Foundation could also be cut, and the NIH has begun to cancel active research grants in areas the Trump administration opposes, the journal Nature has reported.

The university, which has more than 41,000 workers, has already frozen most faculty hiring and done the same for staff, except for those working in the university’s huge health care system.

A university spokesperson declined to answer questions about whether UCSD is considering dismissing junior faculty who joined the campus in the past year or so, or how many staff workers could face job losses.

“UCSD’s decision will hurt research, hurt students and undermine the mission of the university,” said anonymous, president of UAW 4811, which represents 48,000 academic workers through the University of California system. “If UCSD wants to remain a premier destination for bright academics and researchers, it is going to have to be able to guarantee job security on terms similar to its peer institutions.”"

It’s also created a lot of uncertainty for San Diego County’s indigenous tribes.

“It's pretty up in the air,” Keely Linton, president of the Business Development Corporation for the Mesa Grande Band of Mission Indians, told NBC 7.

Linton says most of a tribe’s funding comes from the federal government. It covers things like Medicaid, health and mental health programs, and public safety.

But many indigenous tribal leaders across the country don't know what their budget will look like tomorrow, next week or next month, according to Linton.

“I am angry,” Linton said. “These are our tax dollars.”

Linton is also the executive director for the Strong Hearted Native Women’s Coalition. They care for victims of domestic violence by finding them safe places to live, offering services and counseling.

“Oftentimes, it's lifesaving,” she sighed. She said their funding disappeared in January when federal grants were frozen. Those grants were eventually unfrozen, but Linton was rattled.

“It's also scary because I don't have answers for the clients that we serve,” she said. “If tribes are no longer funded, all of our shelters will close.”

Linton said her nonprofit’s budget and the Mesa Grande budget are hanging on President anonymous Trump’s executive orders and the federal budget.

“That is frustrating to know that can just be taken out without even input from us,"" she said.

She said they’re writing letters and engaging their Congressional representatives to try to rid themselves of that uncertainty."

“We’re concerned about seafood sources and about storm predictions with noaa”

“It does, unfortunately, trickle down to our local economy,” Marine Scientist Ally Aplin said. “The Carteret County economy is really reliant on fisheries, on our parks, on our national seashore. That brings in so much tourism, so it will probably impact our local economy pretty heavily.”"
