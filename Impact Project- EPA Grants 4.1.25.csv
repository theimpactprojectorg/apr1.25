Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International has been selected to serve as the EPA Region 4 and National-Central Grantmaker providing support to communities across EPA Regions 4-7, with a dedicated focus on EPA Region 7. RTI s diverse team brings expertise in grant management, environmental science, environmental justice, equity and #8208;centered research and evaluation.  and nbsp;RTI s proposed solution advances racial equity by positioning community members, as part of a Community Advisory Board (CAB), as decision makers in selecting sub awardees and subgrantees. RTI s process includes targeted outreach and recruitment strategies inclusive and accessible to potential applicants in various modalities, and culturally appropriate to reach communities. RTI International will support the infrastructure to quickly launch an applications intake, review, and award process that is significantly simplified from current federal grants processes. RTI International will receive an initial award of $25,000,000 of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding to stand-up the infrastructure to support communities directly, as well as support the Regional Grantmakers in the Central Regions and the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;Once the infrastructure is established, RTI International will receive a subsequent award of $75,000,000 to implement subgranting programs in EPA Regions 4 and EPA Regions 7, as well as to provide support to the EJ TCGM network as a whole.  and nbsp;This bifurcated awards process is being implemented by EPA to ensure that the Grantmakers have sufficient time to establish the necessary grantmaking infrastructure before beginning to issue subgrants. The EJ TCGM program is a key lever to advance environmental justice and improve public health in communities across the central regions while ensuring that community members can shape the process.

Activities:
RTI International and its partners will come together to serve as the Region 4 and National-Central Grantmakers. Activities to be performed during this project are:

1) RTI will work, in consultation with EPA regional leaders and community representatives, to identify and engage three (3) new statutory partners located within Region 7 to ensure TCGM provides direct support to communities within the region. 

2) RTI International will implement the community-engaged transformative governance model to support the type of decision-making that acknowledges that community organizations have the authority to define success for their projects, decide on the type of interventions they most need, and contribute to the grantmaking process. The community advisory boards (CABs) are the cornerstone of the program. While applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, CABs will meet to make funding decisions on a quarterly basis. They are also charged with guiding the program implementation within the regions.  In consultation with EPA regional leaders, TCGM partners, and community member input, RTI will develop selection criteria to select Community Advisory Board (CAB) members. RTI will work closely to ensure that selection for CAB members considers contextual equity considerations so that the TCGM program can serve those communities that it is intended to benefit.

221,,07-03-2024,Denver Urban Gardens&rsquo; (DUG) Dig Deeper Initiative (DDI),"This agreement provides funding under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to Denver Urban Gardens.  The recipient will provide access, skills, and resources for people to grow healthy food in the community and regenerate urban green spaces. DUG is proposing to provide the Dig Deeper Initiative (DDI) in targeted West Denver neighborhoods to achieve the following public health and environmental benefits, address environmental justice issues and achieve community health and sustainability.

Environmental benefits of this project are to 1) Decrease urban heat island in neighborhoods with some of the city and rsquo;s lowest tree equity scores through the DUG Food Forest Initiative which brings fruit bearing trees and perennials to existing community gardens, new gardens, vacant lots, park space, and community partner space; 2) Increase carbon sequestration capacity of community gardens and other greenspaces within the targeted neighborhoods to improve overall air quality; 3) Decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the targeted area by increasing local food options, thereby decreasing food miles required for residents to obtain fresh, healthy foods. 4) Water benefits which are especially critical in Denver and rsquo;s high desert climate - community gardens and food forests use significantly less water than turf and provide greater water retention in healthy soil.

Public Health benefits of this project will benefit residents of the six neighborhoods included in the project. According to the EPA and rsquo;s EJ-Screen, more than 60% of residents in these neighborhoods identify as Black, Indigenous, or a Person of Color (BIPOC), and more than 70% of households have low and/or limited incomes. For residents who engage with gardens and food forests, expected benefits include 1) Increase physical health indicators including: amount of fruits and vegetables consumed, levels of physical activity, and amount of fiber consumed; 2) Increase mental health indicators including levels of self-reported feelings of happiness, connection and wellbeing, and reduction in stress, depression and anxiety; 3) Increase access to fresh, healthy, local, seasonal food; and 4) Increase resident leadership, advocacy capacity, and connectedness to address issues of food access and environmental justice.



Activities:
The activities include supporting the cultivation of over thirty-four acres of urban land including sites in six of the seven counties within the Denver metro area. Within its network, DUG gardeners grow over 650,000 pounds of produce every year, with 10% or 65,000 pounds of this yield being donated through food pantries and other food security focused organizations. Through DUG and rsquo;s signature community garden program, DUG manages the land use agreement with the land holders (in a few cases DUG owns the land outright), while providing the following supports that ensure that gardens and gardeners can thrive and produce optimal yields of fresh local foods while strengthening community. DUG is incorporating fruit trees and other edible perennials into its current garden landscapes to provide a greater range of food access as well as tree canopy that supports the diversity of vegetation in the area while sequestering carbon and decreasing the urban heat island effect. For the DDI, DUG will recruit GLP members who are residents of the targeted neighborhoods, ensuring that there is resident representation in the program while providing an opportunity for re-skilling or up-skilling to engage in different fields of work to address limited employment opportunities in the area.

224,,11-26-2024,Inflation Reduction Act - Environmental Justice Government-to-Government,"The Copper Corridor and rsquo;s environmental injustices stem from historic mining activities and an archaic mining tax structure that benefits more populated communities in Arizona instead of those directly affected by mining. The Copper Corridor includes communities in south central Arizona, specifically southern Gila County and eastern Pinal County. Historic mining and smelting operations have deposited lead, arsenic, and other heavy metals in residential and industrial yards throughout the Copper Corridor, contaminated surface waters, and created non-attainment areas due to sulfur dioxide and lead in the air. The boom and bust of historic mining have left properties with convoluted titles that sit idle and deteriorate to the point buildings are blighted and become a hinderance to the community. The blight is not only unsightly but creates additional health burdens on already burdened communities. Gila County and its partners will use grant funds to tackle blight through a Mining Tax Distribution Study, using funds for non-hazardous cleanups, asbestos and lead surveys and abatements, demolition, public outreach and engagement and helping communities use their  and lsquo;Clean and Lien and rsquo; programs to create a revolving fund to address blight and create a model program that can be replicated in other rural Arizona communities.

Specifically, the funds will be used to develop a new regulatory air monitoring station near Durant, Oklahoma and an informational air monitoring site near Idabel, Oklahoma. and nbsp; Both sites will be within the jurisdictional boundaries of the and nbsp;Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The land of the Choctaw Nation Reservation is comprised of 10 1/2 counties in Southeastern Oklahoma and approximately 11,000 square miles. The Reservation land is considered disadvantaged according to the Justice40 Initiative and the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool because it meets multiple burden thresholds and the socioeconomic threshold. and nbsp; The Reservation is particularly vulnerable to ozone and particulate matter greenhouse gases due to surrounding anthropogenic influences. The only air monitoring site for ozone and particulate matter within the boundaries of the Choctaw Nation is in McAlester, Oklahoma in the northwest part of the Reservation. and nbsp; There are no air monitors for ozone and particulate matter near the southern border to monitor the air pollution being transported from Texas onto the Reservation. and nbsp; The addition of these air monitoring sites on the southeast and southwest corners of the Reservation will allow the Choctaw Nation to determine the air quality in these previously unmonitored areas. and nbsp; and nbsp;

The new air monitoring station will monitor for ozone and particulate matter being transported onto the Reservation from the Dallas/Fort Worth non-attainment area. The United States Environmental Protection Agency s (USEPA) siting criteria outlined in 40 CFR Part 58 Appendix E for establishing new monitoring sites will be adhered to during the project period.

241,,06-04-2024,"Drying seaweed using waste heat: a proof of concept to build community resilience for food security and economic diversity in PWS, AK.","The agreement provides funding to Prince William Sound Science and Technology Institute. Specifically, the recipient will determine if waste heat can be used to efficiently dry large quantities of seaweed. The objectives are to 1) establish a temporary structure that uses waste heat from a diesel power plant to dry seaweed efficiently, 2) identify long-term options for processing and assess business viability, 3) build acceptance or social license for mariculture and 4) provide training to increase the mariculture workforce. These objectives will provide dedicated capacity and directly support mariculture industry growth for Prince William Sound and coastal Alaskan communities. The Prince William Sound is located in southcentral Alaska and is home to five communities, Chenega, Cordova, Tatitlek, Valdez, and Whittier. Their economy is disproportionately affected by environmental issues because of their dependence upon commercial salmon fisheries. Since 2016, Prince William Sound has experienced five fisheries disasters, drastic population declines, that have affected all five salmon species native to this region. The COVID-19 pandemic added to economic strain and food insecurity by disrupting supply chains that provide 95% of Alaska and rsquo;s food. The State of Alaska and the Prince William Sound Economic Development District have identified the mariculture industry to increase economic diversity and food security. Prince William Sound currently holds 26% of Alaska and rsquo;s seaweed farm permits and thousands of pounds of kelp is harvested each year. However, there is no dedicated capacity to process seaweed. This is a barrier that prevents growth of an industry that can increase economic diversity and food security, which the objectives of this project will address. 


Activities:
The activities include: establishing a temporary structure for drying seaweed using waste heat from a power plant; drying locally grown seaweed; quantifying drying times, rates, heating needs and labor hours necessary for adequate drying; analyzing the data; holding regular stakeholder meetings; reassessing and optimizing drying efficiency; building social license for kelp farming; evaluating scalability and long-term solutions; assessing business viability; training current a prospective kelp farmers about kelp processing; and disseminating results

Outcomes:
The anticipated deliverables include drying data, business viability analysis, 40 participants trained on kelp processing, results dissemination through conference presentations, newsletters, and public engagement activities.
The expected outcomes include an optimized kelp processing procedure, a developed workforce of kelp farmers, the scalability of social license, a long-term plan for the mariculture industry in the community.

252,,04-10-2024,Building Capacity for Addressing Environmental Justice Concerns in Metro East through 9 modules. Curriculum provided by U.S. EPA.,"In response to environmental justice concerns, Kappa House in partnership with Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and U.S. EPA Region 5 is undertaking efforts to support community capacity and build local leaders in the form of the Metro East Environmental Justice Academy, the first academy in Illinois and second in Region 5. The EJ Academy is a roughly 10-month long program where participants will cultivate skills to identify environmental challenges and accomplish environmental improvement goals in their communities. The academy encourages collaborative problem-solving with local government, small businesses, academic institutions, and industry to create a shared vision among different stakeholders so that all parts of a community have a voice in addressing local environmental concerns.The Academy seeks to cover subject matter such as how to apply for grants, the legal process to pass a local ordinance, training around industrial permitting processes and opportunities for community input. More than anything it s a space to collaborate, network, and create tangible change.
While EPA provides the learning objectives for the curriculum and helps plan and facilitate, the programming is tailored to meet the unique needs of the area. Sponsors invited community leaders to participate in an advisory council to inform the planning process for the Academy. Additionally, local speakers were identified to tailor the Academy to bring in local leaders and experts. The EJ Academy will result in building the capacity of existing community leaders and inspiring new leaders to act.


Activities:
Guided instruction and activities through a series of nine modules.
Field trips for perspective and knowledge of local areas of concern or resources.
Education on community involvement in federal processes.
Constructive dialogue of areas of improvement in community involvement in federal.
Opportunities for meaningful engagement with various community stakeholders and networking.
 
The Academy seeks to cover subject matter such as how to apply for grants, the legal process to pass a local ordinance, training around industrial permitting processes and opportunities for community input. The Academy will bring in speakers from federal government agencies, largely to include EPA, as an opportunity to speak to meaningful involvement in their respective programs. This may look like education on the federal permit process and how to write effective comments on federal permits. It would also serve as an opportunity to provide training on federal systems that are publicly accessible, such as ECHO and EJScreen. Providing resources and education can also give the public a better understanding of their role in EPA and rsquo;s mission.
 
In region 5 one other academy has been conducted in Dayton, Ohio. This academy has generally been considered a success with the fellows moving on to accomplish concrete change in their communities, like adding stop signs in high traffic neighborhoods, successfully receiving federal grants, and one fellow being awarded Ohio environmental activist of the year. While EPA provides the learning objectives for the curriculum and helps plan and facilitate, the programming is tailored to meet the unique needs of the area. Sponsors invite community leaders to participate in an advisory council to inform the planning process for the Academy. Advisory council members include leaders from local organizations; public schools, East Side Aligned, Jackie Joyner Kersee Foundation Food and Nutrition Center, Empire 13, United Congregations of Metro East, and several others. Local interest centers around flooding and water infrastructure, food access and equity, and what part residents can have in the industrial permitting process. The EJ Academy will result in building the capacity of existing community leaders and inspiring new leaders to act for tangible change.

RTI will serve in the capacity of a National Grantmaker (Central Regions) as well as the provision of direct assistance to Regions 4 and Region 7.  RTI will implement and deploy federal financial assistance to instill resilience to underserved communities inclusive of Regions 4, 5, 6 and 7.

This funding is the latter half of the bifurcated award that will be used for passthrough grantmaking activities authorized under CAA 138(b  The RTI National Grantmaker (Central Regions) will be funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) appropriations at the level totaling $120 million and divided into two awards. The Initial Award of $25 million was made in August 2024 and the subsequent award of $95 million is slated for December 2024. The bifurcated award is sourced from the same funding but will maintain separate but overlapping timelines to meet the overall components of the award. The Subsequent Award includes award competition, selection and distribution of funds, capacity building and technical assistance for Regional Grantmakers and subrecipients, participatory governance and outreach efforts that will support the regional Grantmakers in 4,5,6, and 7 as well as addressing coverage gaps that they may have difficulty reaching. Gaps include, but is not limited to, remote and/or rural areas of the U.S. Territories and parts of the contiguous United States. 

OEJECR has also provided additional within-scope supplemental funding for each Grantmaker to address  Quality Assurance (QA), Human Subjects Review (HSR), as well as provide funding for additional meaningful outreach and gap filling to remote, rural and hard-to-reach areas of the country, and territories that must be adjusted due to elevated travel costs. Supplemental funds total  $20M of the $95 million and will be used to support the successful distribution and completion projects funded under the subawards.
It should be noted that the Initial Award enabled the Grantmaker to perform the tasks needed to plan and implement proposed participatory governance, outreach, and system mobilization efforts that established the criteria for the collection, review, selection, and distribution of the EJ Thriving Communities Subawards. The pass-through model developed by EPA is central to the new approach, as it  allows the Grantmakers to distribute smaller subawards to community-based organizations (CBOs) more efficiently than the traditional federal grants process. This model will endeavor to ensure that underserved communities can access funds more quickly and with fewer administrative burdens. The work previously conducted under the Environmental Justice Small Grants program will be managed by Grantmakers while allowing EPA to focus on assessment, planning, and project development.

RTI has extensive experience in grantmaking and providing technical support for equity-centered approaches that build collaborative environmentally based outcomes and will endeavor to ensure that EPA funds under the Thriving Community Grantmaker Program are managed and distributed to communities that are most in need of addressing health and environmental challenges. By increasing funding access and reducing administrative barriers, the EPA aims to empower disadvantaged communities to address long-standing environmental justice challenges. This approach aligns with the goals of Executive Orders 13985 and 14008, which prioritize equitable access to federal resources and emphasizes the need for inclusive decision-making processes that advance environmental justice nationwide.

376,,02-23-2024,Advancing tree equity and environmental justice in Spokane County through urban forestry career development and educational programs,"The agreement provides funding to Spokane Conservation District. Specifically, the recipient will conduct a project that will address the environmental justice problem that low-income neighborhoods in Spokane County, Washington, have very few shade trees. The number of trees in a neighborhood has important environmental, health, social, and quality-of-life implications. For example, tree planting is a low-cost strategy that reduces heat-related illnesses and mortalities, mitigates flood risk, increases carbon storage, and improves water and air quality while contributing to neighborhood beautification. Through this project, Spokane Conservation District (SCD) will lead activities that engage high school and community college students to increase the number of trees in areas identified as having low canopy cover and a high proportion of low-income residents.

The project s goal is to improve climate resilience, environmental justice, water and air quality, public health, and economic outcomes in Spokane County and rsquo;s disadvantaged communities by engaging high school and college students from these communities in natural resource and environmental education and professional development programs that increase tree canopy cover in their communities.

Activities:
The activities include 1) partnering with Pacific Education Institute to increase high school students and rsquo; participation in environmental and natural resource conservation careers, with a focus on increasing the representation of people from historically disadvantaged populations and 2) establishing an apprenticeship program for students who graduate from participating high schools and enroll in the Spokane Community College Arboriculture/Urban Forestry or Natural Resource Management program. The SCD apprenticeship program will collaborate with The Lands Council, City of Spokane Valley, City of Airway Heights Parks and Recreation, and Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners to provide tree planning, planting, maintenance, and technical assistance for low-income residents, public buildings and parks, and street rights-of-way in Airway Heights and Spokane Valley. 

Outcomes:
The anticipated deliverables include launching the Spokane County Natural Resource Apprenticeship Program to prepare Spokane Community College students from Airway Heights and Spokane Valley for careers in urban forestry and green infrastructure (300 trees planted per year); developing and implementing the PEI Youth Engaged in Sustainable Systems (YESS) summer program for Airway Heights and Spokane Valley high school students to increase awareness of and participation in environmental and natural resource conservation careers among historically disadvantaged populations; and developing high-quality, research-based K-12 community and urban forestry educational curricula that supports critical thinking and civic engagement along with relevant science, math, and English Language Arts components.

The expected outcomes include improved climate resilience, an expanded pool of natural resource professionals with greater representation of historically disadvantaged populations, and increased societal awareness and commitment to environmental protection.

The intended beneficiaries include low-income residents, public buildings and parks, and street rights-of-way in Airway Heights and Spokane Valley.
